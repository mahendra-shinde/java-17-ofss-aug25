# Introduction to Java Language

Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language developed by Sun Microsystems in 1995. It is designed to be platform-independent, secure, and easy to use, making it one of the most popular programming languages in the world.

**Features of Java Language:**
- **Object-Oriented:** Supports encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
- **Platform Independent:** "Write once, run anywhere" capability using the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
- **Simple and Familiar:** Syntax is easy to learn, especially for those familiar with C or C++.
- **Robust and Secure:** Strong memory management and built-in security features.
- **Multithreaded:** Supports concurrent execution of two or more threads.
- **Automatic Garbage Collection:** Manages memory automatically, reducing memory leaks.

## Java Virtual Machine

The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is an abstract computing machine that enables a computer to run Java programs as well as programs written in other languages that are compiled to Java bytecode. The JVM provides platform independence, security, and automatic memory management (garbage collection). It interprets compiled Java bytecode and translates it to machine code for the host system.

**Key Points:**
- Platform independence: Write once, run anywhere
- Automatic memory management
- Security features (sandboxing, bytecode verification)
- Performance optimizations (JIT compilation)

## Java Runtime Environment

The Java Runtime Environment (JRE) is a package of software that provides the libraries, Java Virtual Machine (JVM), and other components required to run applications written in Java. The JRE does not include development tools such as compilers or debuggers.

**Key Points:**
- Contains JVM, core libraries, and supporting files
- Required to run Java applications
- Does not include development tools

## Java Development Kit

The Java Development Kit (JDK) is a full-featured software development kit for Java. It includes the JRE, an interpreter/loader (Java), a compiler (javac), an archiver (jar), a documentation generator (javadoc), and other tools needed for Java development.

**Key Points:**
- Includes JRE and development tools
- Used for developing, compiling, and debugging Java applications
- Essential for Java developers

## Java Language Version History

Java has evolved significantly since its initial release. Each version introduces new features, enhancements, and bug fixes. Here is a brief overview:

- **Java 1.0 (1996):** Initial release
- **Java 2 (1.2, 1.3, 1.4):** Collections framework, Swing, performance improvements
- **Java 5 (2004):** Generics, metadata, enumerated types, autoboxing
- **Java 6 (2006):** Scripting support, performance improvements
- **Java 7 (2011):** Try-with-resources, diamond operator, NIO.2
- **Java 8 (2014):** Lambda expressions, Stream API, new Date/Time API
- **Java 9 (2017):** Module system (Project Jigsaw)
- **Java 10-16:** Local variable type inference, new APIs, performance improvements
- **Java 17 (2021):** Long-term support (LTS), sealed classes, pattern matching, new APIs

## Features of Java 17

Java 17 is a Long-Term Support (LTS) release, bringing stability and new features to the Java platform. Some of the key features include:

- **Sealed Classes:** Restrict which classes can extend or implement a class
- **Pattern Matching for switch (Preview):** Simplifies conditional logic
- **Strong Encapsulation of JDK Internals:** Improves security and maintainability
- **New APIs and Enhancements:** Improved performance, new methods in standard libraries
- **Deprecations and Removals:** Removal of older, less-used features for a cleaner platform

Java 17 is recommended for production use due to its LTS status and ongoing support from Oracle and the Java community.
